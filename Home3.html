          The origins and present conditions of the lakes in Kelimutu, Dr.G.G.L Kemmerling in the Volcanoes of Flores stated that the morphology is complicated. It is suspected that the old Kelimutu Volcano became a caldera and a new peak cone formed within it, which in turn was partially destroyed. Finally, two crater holes formed on the eastern summit and one on the western.

The red lake has a diameter of about 400 meters and a depth of about 60 meters. The red color is the result of red iron deposition at the bottom. The crater no longer shows any volcanic activity.

The green lake located right next to it has the same lake level as the red lake, but is at a much more active stage. Both of these lakes are about 1,410 meters high, while the highest peak of Kelimutu is 1,639 meters above sea level. The rim of the crater is between 1,500 meters and 1,600 meters. Even though the solfatar may be weak with the roar like a locomotive working hard, the three times I visited the lake, I heard only a faint roar, where the eruptions still carried a lot of sulfur, so the surface of the lake was covered with lumps of sulfuric foam. dry, and the wall above the solfatara has bleached a bright color (fig. 8).

The sediment that causes the turbidity of the water consists of sulfur, which is thought to be formed by the reducing action of hydrogen sulfide on sulfuric acid. The water is highly acidic and has a corrosive effect on the skin. This lake is about the same size as the red lake, but almost twice as deep.

        The third blue-green lake is ten meters lower in lake level, and is confined to a fairly strong emission of hydrogen sulfide, or gas. The water is less acidic than the second lake, but still more acidic than the red lake. The blast hole that occurred where the lake was located had a diameter of about 300 meters. Not much is known about Kelimutu's former activities. Tradition has it that the narrow, sharp ridge between the murky green and red lakes was once as high as the crater rim.

About 80 years ago, a powerful eruption of solfatar from the green lake's murky water would have largely shattered its walls. And this, I think would summarize the main volcanic features. And finally about Kelimutu as an object of nature conservation (object voor natuurbescherming).

The entire peak of Kelimutu is included in a protected forest (wildhoutbousch) and thus has been protected from exploitation by the people around it. Meanwhile, while the road is under construction it seems it would be best to declare this unique place a natural monument. Due to the natural development towards the lake area, many views which were very romantic have undeniably been lost'.

        The small forest is still being cut down for the construction of stairs and fences, and during that time many conscripts who are working on the road burn lots of it. This would not have been possible if the entire area had been declared a natural monument. Even now on my last visit the tall logs in the old cypress forest have been cleared to make way for the long girders of the bridges, and of course pillars of smoke rise everywhere as branches and brush burn. It is true that Raja van Lio's promise to meet the needs of the bridge construction will cut it elsewhere for the future of Kelimutu's natural environment, but it goes without saying that the protection of nature in this area does not guarantee it. It was immediately recognized that with the establishment of natural monuments or natural parks, these things would not change as if by magic, but it was still hoped that people would gradually begin to respect and preserve our rare and beautiful earth. And it's definitely worth it.
